
-be able to view multiple cameras from split screens.
improve camera controls - scrolling past zero should push the center forward. When you are moving the camera, it should show the center.


-Customizable mouse controls (swap left/right click, sensitivity, etc)
-Keyboard substitutes for mouse controls (for people with macs) - right click, scroll wheel


-lcd screen - a rectangle with words on it for monitoring the state of the world. it can display text perhaps, or just change colors.
-hit points/strength could be just a function of the mass or density of objects

-key activated sources (with various options for key mapping)
-batteries need on/off switches

Required features:

Should be able to pick up / throw objects in physics
Should be able to pause physics, and stop it with positions preserved

On cameras, you should be able to check a box saying "Rotate With". This should let your camera have the same position as what it's attached to, but not rotate with it!
material properties must copy !



hard to make a box when aligned to grid.
motors should make it obvious what direction they are going.


function editor settings revert to one when you close the window.

properties should show current stats (weights, etc) for objects, not just densities
function editor doesnt have a scale written on it anymore

function generator should show mouse tooltip with x/y coordinates

make the floor semitransparent when you are under it



Done:
*A sensor to detect balance (ie, detect gravity's direction relative to it)
*-Avoiding self-detection for object sensors
*-Camera should be a physics object
*-should be able to copy objects between files.
*-An icon showing when the physics are lagging (progress bar instead))
*-deletable wires
*-motors: respond to input as acceleration, or as speed.
*glue!
*velocity sensor
*acceleration sensor
*altitude sensor
lock to one axis mode

possible features:
-paint mode, where you select a color and then click on anything you want to paint...
-binary operator component - multiply, add, subtract, divide, remainder, etc.
-multiplexer 
sensor dead fields - blue sensor fields, any sensor wired to the dead field will ignore objects in that space
when you are in an embedded camera, you can disable rotating with the camera (so that when the object is flipping around, your view stays steady)
when you zoom past 0 distance, it should push the middle of the camera forward by that amount. Pressing a key should show where the center of the camera is.

homeworld style color options in the color options menu - ie, have a bunch of boxes in the color chooser, that user can assign their own colors to, and then pick from later.

pause button for physics
fall button in the constructor: a given item falls down as low as it can.
Friction scaling slider
Hinge rotation in group mode rotating other stuff along with the hinge (ask David for clarification)


orientation sensor/gyroscope/compass
rotationsensor for axle, feedback sensors for all joints

magnets

torpedos (only work under water)

distance sensor should be able to tell the difference between static and non static objects.

*-redo the toolbar system to account for resolution adjustments.
*-get rid of minimum zoom distance on camera. Let you continue moving forwards as you zoom past zero.



Dream features:
stickers that can be glued onto the vehicles, to personalize them
working 2D physics semitransparent rain/circles for menu.
-make surface area work for glue.
