#Golems Translation File Format
#Copyright 2009, Sam Bayless
#
#Instructions (ENGLISH)~ This file contains a nested list of items in Golems that need translation
#Each item has a permanent name, called a KEY, that Golems knows to call, written in all capitals, and followed by a tilde, such as
#
#CAMERA~
#
#This part does not need to be translated - dont change it.
#Next to each of these items is a tilde ("~") followed by a translation in the target language
#For example, the English translation would be:
#
#CAMERA~ Camera
#
#or French:
#
#CAMERA~ Appareil photo
#
#or Italian:
#
#CAMERA~ Fotocamera
#
#There are also some lines that look like this:
#
#MAIN_MENU{
# ...
# ...
# ...
#}
#
#These are organizational elements that help divide the file into sections related to a certain
#topic, such as the file menu or the appearance menu or the toolbar, etc.
#The part in all caps does not need to be translated, but it will contain entries that
#do need translation.
#
#
#Lines beginning with the pound symbol ('#') are ignored - they are for comments about the file.
#You may write notes on your translation in the file by adding Comment lines.
#
#Translations may contain any character, including new lines, except for tilde ("~"), open and close curly braces ("{" and "}") and pound ("#") 
#Leading and trailing spaces and new lines on translations are ignored; a translation line may NOT end with a pound or a comment ("#"). 
#
#
#Future versions of Golems may add new or remove old KEYS - that is ok, you can leave the old ones in, and they will just
#be ignored (plus, that way if we go back to using old keys in the future, we will still have the translation).
