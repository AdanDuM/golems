Build with the following series of instructions, from the golems directory:

$ cd ant
$ ant 

This will build Golems for Windows, Mac, and Linux, in the folder ant/dist/${PLATFORM}
Note: if you are running on linux, then the linux launching script, "Golems.sh", will need to manually have its permissions set to executable.
Or, on any platform, run "java -jar launcher.jar" from the distribution directory.
